Miva Template Language (MVT) is now Miva IDE!

Changes include:
* Miva Script syntax highlighting support.

### NOTE
If you have any settings relying on the path of the MVT.tmLanguage file you will need to update it.
The new path will be:
	
	```
	Packages/Miva IDE/MVT.tmLanguage
	```

---

NEW Features coming soon:
* Miva Script tag snippets.
* Miva Script autocompleition of builtin and Merchant functions.
* MVT.tmLanguage -> MVT.sublime-syntax (to take advantage of some new features of the format change)
