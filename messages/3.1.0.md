# Miva Template Language (MVT) is now Miva IDE!

### NOTE
If you have any settings relying on the path of the MVT.tmLanguage file you will need to update it.
The new path is:

```
Packages/Miva IDE/MVT.sublime-syntax
```

### Changlog for v3.1.0:
* Added scope-based autocompletion for runtime variables.
* Dynamic variable autcompletion added `l.` and `g.` scopes.

### Dynamic Variable Autocompletion:
Variables referenced within the current buffer will be added to the autocompletion list when typing within a local or global scope.

### Runtime Variable Autocompletion:
The runtime variable autocompletion list will activate after typing `g.` or `s.`.

For example, a list of system `http` variables will be listed after typing `s.http` within `source.mvt` or `source.mv.expr` scopes:
	http_accept
	http_accept_encoding
	http_accept_language
	http_cache_control
	http_connection
	http_cookie
	http_host
	http_if_modified_since
	http_origin
	http_referer
	http_user_agent
	http_x_accel_internal
	http_x_real_ip

You can use this feature to fuzzy search through these pre-defined variables without having to use the Admin Tokenlist module.

The list of variables will be updated with future releases.
