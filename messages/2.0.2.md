# Miva Template Language (MVT) is now Miva IDE!

### NOTE
If you have any settings relying on the path of the MVT.tmLanguage file you will need to update it.
The new path is:

```
Packages/Miva IDE/MVT.tmLanguage
```

---

### Changlog for v2.0.2:
* Fixed an issue with the builtin function autocomplete (missing scopes).
